## Libraries/Dependencies

This project uses the following key libraries:

- **React**: For building the user interface. React provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to manage the state and layout of the invoice creation form.
  
- **jsPDF**: For generating PDF files from the input data. The jsPDF library allows the dynamic creation of PDF files in the browser, enabling users to download their generated invoices.

## Customization

You can customize the look and feel of the invoice template by editing the React components. Here are a few areas you can modify:

- **React Components**: The components define the structure of the invoice and the form inputs. You can add new sections, adjust the existing ones, or change the layout.
  
- **CSS Styling**: The styling and layout of the invoice template can be modified by adjusting the CSS files. You can change fonts, colors, margins, padding, and overall design to suit your needs.
  
- **Adding More Fields**: If you want to include more input fields for additional information (like taxes, shipping address, etc.), simply modify the form in the React components to include those fields. You can also update the corresponding sections in the PDF generation logic to display the newly added fields.

By adjusting these components, you can create a personalized invoice template that fits your specific requirements.
